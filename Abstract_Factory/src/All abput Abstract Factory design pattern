When to Use Abstract Factory Pattern?
Use the Abstract Factory pattern when:

âœ… Multiple Related Factories Are Needed â€“ When your application needs to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

âœ… Decoupling Object Creation from Client Code â€“ When you want to isolate the object creation logic from the client, making it easier to modify or extend the system.

âœ… Ensuring Consistency Among Objects â€“ When you need a set of objects that should be used together (e.g., GUI themes, database connectors, or operating system-specific implementations).

âœ… Supporting Different Configurations or Environments â€“ When your application needs to work with multiple configurations dynamically (e.g., different UI themes or multiple database types).

Why Use Abstract Factory Pattern?
âœ” Encapsulation of Object Families â€“ Groups related objects together and ensures they are used consistently.
âœ” Promotes Loose Coupling â€“ Clients remain unaware of the specific classes being instantiated, improving flexibility.
âœ” Enhances Scalability â€“ Makes it easy to introduce new product families without modifying existing code.
âœ” Improves Code Maintainability â€“ Centralizes object creation, reducing duplication and complexity in client code.

Real-World Use Cases
ðŸ”¹ Cross-Platform UI Frameworks â€“ Creates UI components (buttons, checkboxes, menus) based on the platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).

ðŸ”¹ Database Connectivity Layers â€“ Provides different database drivers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) without exposing concrete implementations.

ðŸ”¹ Automobile Manufacturing System â€“ Generates car parts (engine, wheels, interiors) based on the car brand (Toyota, Tesla, BMW).

ðŸ”¹ Game Development â€“ Creates different enemy types and game elements based on difficulty levels or environments.

ðŸš€ By using the Abstract Factory pattern, you can build flexible, scalable, and maintainable applications that adapt to changing requirements!
