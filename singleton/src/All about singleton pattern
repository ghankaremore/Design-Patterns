When to Use Singleton Pattern?
Use the Singleton pattern when:

Only One Instance is Needed â€“ When your application requires exactly one shared instance of a class (e.g., configuration manager, logging, database connection).
Global Access â€“ When multiple parts of the application need to access the same instance without creating multiple objects.
Resource Management â€“ When dealing with expensive objects like database connections, caches, or thread pools, where creating multiple instances is unnecessary or costly.


Why Use Singleton Pattern?
Ensures a single point of control over shared resources.
Improves performance by reducing memory usage and object creation overhead.
Helps in synchronizing access to shared resources in multithreaded applications.



Real-World Use Cases
ðŸ”¹ Database Connection Pool â€“ Ensures a single instance of a database connection manager to optimize resource usage.
ðŸ”¹ Logging System â€“ Maintains a single logger instance to manage application-wide logging efficiently.
ðŸ”¹ Configuration Manager â€“ Loads and provides access to application-wide settings in a single instance.
ðŸ”¹ Thread Pool Manager â€“ Prevents the overhead of creating multiple thread pool instances.
