✅ When to Use Prototype Pattern?
Use the Prototype pattern when:

✅ Object Creation is Costly – When creating an object from scratch (e.g., database read, network call, or complex computation) is resource-intensive.

✅ You Need Many Similar Objects – When you need to create multiple instances with similar configurations or partially modified copies of an existing object.

✅ Avoiding Subclassing – When instantiating a class directly or via subclassing is complex or not flexible enough.

✅ You Want to Keep Object Creation Independent of the Class Hierarchy – When your code shouldn't be tightly coupled with specific class constructors.

⭐ Why Use Prototype Pattern?
✔ Improves Performance – Speeds up object creation by cloning instead of building from scratch.

✔ Reduces Complexity – Simplifies creation of similar or pre-configured objects.

✔ Enables Runtime Object Configuration – Allows new objects to be created at runtime by copying existing instances.

✔ Simplifies Object Creation Logic – Eliminates the need for repetitive instantiation logic across the application.

🌍 Real-World Use Cases
🔹 Graphic Editors – Duplicate shapes, images, or components quickly by cloning existing ones with minor changes.

🔹 Game Development – Clone characters, enemies, or obstacles with shared base properties but slight variations.

🔹 Document Templates – Create new documents from predefined templates by cloning and modifying them.

🔹 Data Prototypes in Machine Learning – Clone and tweak data points or models for experimentation without retraining or reloading.

🚀 The Prototype pattern is powerful when object creation is heavy or repetitive, and you want to make performance and flexibility a priority.
