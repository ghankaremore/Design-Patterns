Ways Singleton Can Be Broken
Despite ensuring a single instance, the Singleton pattern can be broken in several ways:

Reflection â€“ Using reflection, we can access the private constructor and create multiple instances.
Cloning â€“ If the Singleton class implements Cloneable, calling clone() can create another instance.
Serialization & Deserialization â€“ When a Singleton is serialized and then deserialized, a new instance can be created.
Multithreading Issues â€“ Improperly implemented Singleton (without synchronization or volatile) can result in multiple instances in a multithreaded environment.


Real-World Implications of Breaking Singleton
ðŸš¨ Security Risks â€“ If an attacker gains access to the Singleton instance via reflection, they can modify its behavior.
ðŸš¨ Memory Issues â€“ If multiple instances are created, memory consumption can increase unexpectedly.
ðŸš¨ Inconsistent State â€“ When a Singleton manages shared resources (e.g., a cache or database connection), breaking it can lead to inconsistent data.
