When to Use Factory Pattern?
Use the Factory pattern when:

âœ… Encapsulation of Object Creation â€“ When the creation logic is complex, encapsulating it in a Factory method helps keep the client code clean and maintainable.

âœ… Decoupling from Concrete Classes â€“ When you want to depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations, improving flexibility and scalability.

âœ… Multiple Object Variants â€“ When a class has multiple variations, and deciding which one to instantiate depends on runtime conditions.

âœ… Enhancing Code Maintainability â€“ When you anticipate frequent changes in object creation logic and want to modify it in one place instead of multiple parts of the code.

Why Use Factory Pattern?
âœ” Improves Maintainability â€“ Changes to object creation logic do not affect client code.
âœ” Promotes Loose Coupling â€“ Encourages programming to an interface rather than a specific implementation.
âœ” Enhances Scalability â€“ Makes it easy to introduce new object types without modifying existing client code.
âœ” Supports Dependency Injection â€“ Useful when managing object dependencies dynamically.

Real-World Use Cases
ðŸ”¹ Database Connection Factory â€“ Creates database connections dynamically based on configuration (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

ðŸ”¹ Notification System â€“ Generates different notification types (Email, SMS, Push Notifications) depending on user preferences.

ðŸ”¹ UI Component Factory â€“ Creates different UI elements (buttons, dialogs, forms) based on user interface requirements.

ðŸ”¹ Shape Factory in Graphics Software â€“ Instantiates different shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) based on user input.

ðŸš€ By implementing the Factory pattern correctly, you can make your code more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain!
