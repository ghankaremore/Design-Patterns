✅ When to Use Builder Pattern?
Use the Builder pattern when:

✅ Object Construction is Complex – When creating an object involves many steps or parameters, especially optional ones.

✅ You Need to Create Different Representations of an Object – When you want to construct different variations of an object using the same construction process.

✅ Immutable Objects Are Preferred – When the object should be immutable after creation but needs a flexible setup during construction.

✅ Too Many Constructor Parameters – When using telescoping constructors becomes confusing and hard to maintain.

⭐ Why Use Builder Pattern?
✔ Improves Readability – Clearly separates object construction from its representation.

✔ Simplifies Object Creation – Makes it easier to create complex objects step by step.

✔ Avoids Constructor Pollution – Eliminates the need for multiple constructors for various combinations of parameters.

✔ Supports Fluent Interface – Enhances the code with method chaining for more intuitive use.

🌍 Real-World Use Cases
🔹 Creating Complex UI Components – Build UI elements like forms, dialogs, or dashboards with optional fields and styles.

🔹 Building SQL Queries or API Requests – Create dynamic and structured queries using a fluent interface.

🔹 Document Generation Systems – Assemble different types of documents (PDF, Word, HTML) step by step with a consistent builder flow.

🔹 Meal or Product Customization Systems – Build customizable products like burgers, pizzas, or computers with various configurations.

🚀 The Builder pattern shines when you want flexibility and control over complex object creation while keeping your code clean and maintainable.
